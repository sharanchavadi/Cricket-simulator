problem context:

Our problem is set in the planet of Lengaburu, in the distant distant galaxy of Tara B. And it's the finals of the Intergalactic T20 Cup! Lengaburu and Enchai, neighbours and fierce rivals, are fighting it out for the title.
Lengaburu's star batsman Kirat Boli is at the crease. Can he win it for Lengaburu? Write code to simulate the last 4 overs of the match.

problem 1: The last FOUR

It's the last 4 overs of the match. Lengaburu needs 40 runs to win and with 3 wickets left. Each player has a
different probability for scoring runs. Your coding problem is to simulate the match, ball by ball.
The match simulation will require you to use a weighted random number generation based on probability to determine the runs scored per ball. For this randomizer, you can use any external library of your choice (if you wish to, the choice is yours).

problem 2: The tie breaker

The final has resulted in a tie! Just like '07. Now the result will be decided by a one over tie breaker. 2 batsmen, 6
balls, who will win?
